Current Version: Pre-RC1, Last Update: 4/30/2015

# Introduction #
Galactic 2D is our first in-house engine technology that takes advantage of numerous open-source, and cross-platform systems to deliver a compact and easy to use modular development engine to create 2D games and applications of numerous types.

# What's Included #
Galactic 2D will include the following core features and mechanics at the RC1 release:

* 64-Bit Windows Platform Support with others to come
* Internal Rendering Systems using OpenGL (GLES) / DX11
* Audio Module using OpenAL/XAudio2
* 128 player multiplayer support with eNet

# What's in the Future? #
Once we finish RC1, which will be our launch version, we'll immediately turn our attention to RC2 and beyond, this will upgrade the engine to also feature:

* Cross-Platform functioning for Linux, Mac, Android, IPhone, and more!
* Compact LUA-JIT FFI Scripting
* Module Loading system for Quick .DLL/.SO/.APP Loading
* Additional External Libraries for in-game features such as GUIs, Particles, and More!

# The Goal #
These features combine together to give both game and application developers an amazing set of tools and mechanics to get off the ground at a fast pace in their development. This engine will be a wonderful asset and a great library of tools and functions for building computer applications and games alike!
